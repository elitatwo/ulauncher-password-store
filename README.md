// DEPRECATED: Since I am not using ulauncher anymore, this extension doesn't support the new API.
And I have sadly no time to dig into it. Forks are welcome.

A hacky [password store](https://www.passwordstore.org/) extension for the [ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/).

Latest features include:
- Search & copy passwords to clipboard.
- Setting a custom password-store path.
- Running a custom command before and after copying password. (Useful for putting clipboard managers into offline mode)
- Optional password generation support with pwgen command. (Directly saving this to pass not *yet* supported)
- Optional [pass-extension-tail](https://git.io/vpSgV) support.

Thanks to:
- [wallace11](https://github.com/wallace11) for parameterization and tail support
